My name is Juventino Saavedra. I'm from Immokalee Florida. I enrolled in this CIST class because, I was always interested in computer systems, coding, and their software. I have always been intrigued and fascinated by the way I see the cybersecurity personnel are able to read the binary language of the computers and are able to respond to any cyber threat very fast. I also wanted to be apart of the real world solutions that this career can offer to make a more secure society. I aim to become a cyber security analyst after I graduate.
